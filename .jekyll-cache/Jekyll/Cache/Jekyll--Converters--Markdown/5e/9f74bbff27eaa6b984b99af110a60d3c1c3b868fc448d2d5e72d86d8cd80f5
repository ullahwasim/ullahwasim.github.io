I"„<p>This year Facebook/Google hosted BountyCon Capture the Flag competition. I participated in it and solved 15 of 17 challenges (except Proof of game and aglet). As Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student and in the learning stage, my solutions will not be optimal. Although I didnâ€™t get selected as a winner, still it was pretty fun and engaging to solve all of these challenges.</p>
