I"~	<p>While testing Mozilla, I found it was possible to include HTML and plaintext in the password reset email coming from Mozilla.
<br /></p>

<p>When resetting the password on Mozilla, I found Mozilla includes browser, OS, and IP in its email notification. They were trying to parse the user-agent string into a readable device description from the request, but when no valid user-agent is provided then the whole string is taken as device description and then the string gets inserted into the email without any further sanity checks. This allows us to include HTML content into the email.</p>

<p><strong>POC</strong></p>

<div class="language-http highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">POST</span> <span class="nn">/v1/password/forgot/send_code</span> <span class="k">HTTP</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1.1</span>

The email looks something like

<p>There wasnâ€™t rate limit on password reset functionality. So, it was possible to send emails in bulk with relevant DKIM/SPF checks passing.</p>
